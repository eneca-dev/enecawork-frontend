# Terminal Usage Rules

## PowerShell Commands

### Operators to Avoid

- **Never use `&&` in PowerShell commands**. The `&&` operator is not natively supported in PowerShell.

### Correct Alternatives

Instead of using `&&` to chain commands, use one of these PowerShell-appropriate approaches:

1. Use semicolons to separate commands:
   ```powershell
   command1; command2; command3
   ```

2. Use the pipeline operator where appropriate:
   ```powershell
   command1 | command2
   ```

3. For conditional execution (only run second command if first succeeds), use:
   ```powershell
   command1; if ($?) { command2 }
   ```

4. For more complex command sequences, use script blocks or functions.

### Examples

❌ **Incorrect:**
```powershell
npm install && npm start
```

✅ **Correct:**
```powershell
npm install; npm start
```

✅ **Correct with error checking:**
```powershell
npm install; if ($?) { npm start }
```
